# BioCast Product and App

The **BioCast** is a product with app that provides an alternative to the cast options available for patients today.

BioCast is made of "living bubbles" that removes the discomfort of a traditional cast such as bacteria growth, swelling, pruritus, and more. The smart bubbles can also be programmed to deliver infrared heat and cooling temperatures.

It is breathable and less bulky than casts made today of plaster or fiberglass.

Through the app, patients can adjust temperature settings as needed based on their Orthopedic doctor's recommendations and their comfort level. Reminders about medication and pain management can potentially help to educate and relieve anxiety.

**[Figure 2]** A more detailed view of the events that occur after the patient visits the hospital for an injury.

**One** An injured person with a fracture, broken bone or sprain would go to the hospital. (Note: The BioCast could also be used post-surgery)

**Two** An x-ray and 3D scan would happen simultaneously to save time.

**Three** The doctor is sent the scans for review.

**Four** If it is determined the patient needs a BioCast, the "smart bubbles" are programmed to be optimized for healing and support. It is highly personalized.

The living bubbles are "alive" and mold to the shape of the person's limb or body.

# BioCast Product and App

The BioCast is a product with app that provides an alternative to the cast options available for patients today.

BioCast is made of "living bubbles" that remove the discomfort of a traditional cast and the potential to heal faster due with hot and cold temperature adjustments.

It is breathable and less bulky than casts made today of X and X.

Patients can adjust temperature settings as needed based on their doctor's recommendations. Reminders about medication and pain management can potentially help to educate and relieve anxiety.

Create a character or piece of art using shapes we've learned in class
Use 5 variables within your character.

_Think about ways you can interact with your piece. When you set up variables think about what you can interact with. Think outside the box, go beyond the screen. Talk about sensors, data, or things that will affect your piece. Create a story for your character._

Senses,
Sensors
Open idea.

Show and tell next week.

Variables are good of automating the process.
Set an arbitraty point on your screen, draw all of your objects based off of that point.
Then add pieces of interaction.

If you see repetition in your code, a variable is a good thing to use in those cases.

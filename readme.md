# CIM640 - Fall 2018

## Creative Coding

Hi, welcome to my Creative Coding documentation. I'm learning p5js for the first time and also learning how to think about the "black box" a.k.a. the "impossible".

My homework and projects so far:

### BioCast*
Because I'm interested in health and wellness.
[View BioCast](https://github.com/dpd28/CIM640/blob/master/Homework/impossible.md) »  

### Oliver, the owl.
Because I love owls.
[See my first p5js illustration and series of interactions](https://dpd28.github.io/CIM640/Homework/p5/drawing/) »
